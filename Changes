       OOBuilder: Windows now also supported: from now on using 
                  Archive::Zip instead of the linux zip utility 
                  with a system call. [thanks to Magnus Nufer]
         If you don't want to use Archive::Zip, and you are on a Linux 
         system with access to a zip program, take a look at the 
         OOBuilder.pm file, search for 'zip', and you will find some 
         instructions how to change this. 
         If you do so, please let me know. If enough people want this to be 
         an option, I'll try to implement that in one of the next releases.
